# 1.0 Point / Scatter Plots ----
# - Great for Continuous vs Continuous
# - Also good for Lollipop Charts (more on this in advanced plots)

# Goal: Explain relationship between order value and quantity of bikes sold

# Data Manipulation
bike_orderlines_tbl %>% 
    select(order_id, order_line, total_price, quantity) %>% 
    group_by(order_id) %>% 
    summarise(
        total_quantity = sum(quantity),
        order_value = sum(total_price)
    ) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 

# Scatter Plot

    ggplot(data = .,

               x = total_quantity,
               y = order_value
           )) + 
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")


# 2.0 Line Plots ----
# - Great for time series

# Goal: Describe revenue by Month, expose cyclic nature

# Data Manipulation

bike_orderlines_tbl %>% 
    select(order_date, total_price) %>% 
    
    mutate(year_month = floor_date(order_date, unit = "months") %>% ymd()) %>%

    y = revenue
)) + 
    geom_line(size = 0.5, linetype = 1) + 
    geom_smooth(method = "loess", span = 0.2, formula = y ~ x)


# 3.0 Bar / Column Plots ----
# - Great for categories

# Goal: Sales by Descriptive Category

# Data Manipulation


# Bar Plot






# 4.0 Histogram / Density Plots ----
# - Great for inspecting the distribution of a variable


# Goal: Unit price of bicycles
# Histogram


# Goal: Unit price of bicylce, segmenting by frame material
# Histogram


# Density




# 5.0 Box Plot / Violin Plot ----
# - Great for comparing distributions


# Goal: Unit price of models, segmenting by category 2

# Data Manipulation


# Box Plot


# Violin Plot & Jitter Plot







# 6.0 Adding Text & Labels ----

# Goal: Exposing sales over time, highlighting outlier

# Data Manipulation


# Adding text to bar chart


# Filtering labels to highlight a point
